  abstract = { White LED offers advantageous properties such as high brightness,
	reliability, lower power consumption and long lifetime. White LEDs
	are expected to serve in the next generation of lamps. An indoor
	visible-light communication system utilizing white LED lights has
	been proposed from our laboratory. In the proposed system, these
	devices are used not only for illuminating rooms but also for an
	optical wireless communication system. Generally, plural lights are
	installed in our room. So, their optical path difference must be
	considered. In this paper, we discuss about the influence of interference
	and reflection. Based on numerical analyses, we show that the system
	is expected to be the indoor communication of the next generation.},
