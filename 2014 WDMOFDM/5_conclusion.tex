\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we introduced wavelength division multiplexing visible light communication system in the context of variable illumination constraints. We then analyzed how variations in correlated color temperature, transmitter spectral power distribution, and the receiver filter transmittance affect the communication performance of such a system. For the three colored system considered, the blue and the green links pose the performance bottlenecks because of the relatively lower contribution to the SPD and lower photodiode responsivity as compared to the red. As the ICI increases, the most power efficient CCT shifts towards lower temperatures. Transmitting elements with the smallest spectral spread provide the most power efficient operating point. The effect of increase in spectral spread is most pronounced in the green link because it suffers the most from interference from the blue and red links. Filters with narrow transmittance reject a lot of the signal power while filters with a broad transmittance accept a lot of interference. Both of these affect the power efficiency of the system. For the setup considered, least power efficient operating point is for DCO-OFDM at CCT = 2500 K, transmitting element SPD spread = 50 nm, and filter FWHM = 1 nm. The most power efficient operating point is for ACO-OFDM at CCT = 6250 K, transmitting element SPD spread = 5 nm, and filter FWHM = 40 nm.
