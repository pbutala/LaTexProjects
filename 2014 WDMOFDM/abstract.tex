%Light emitting diodes have started replacing the conventional light sources such as incandescent or fluorescent bulbs to provide illumination in indoor spaces. Recent research efforts have tried to smartly deploy these devices to create an optical wireless communication downlink while providing illumination. Use of multi-colored light emitting diodes in a light source provides the ability to (a) tune the color of the light, and (b) establish multiple, parallel wavelength division multiplexed channels. Optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing provides high spectral efficiency over an optical channel. In this work, we analyze how the performance of wavelength and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing is affected by variations in (a) spectral width of the light emitted from the source, (b) color temperature of aggregate spectrum generated by emitted light, and (c) optical filter bandwidth used for wavelength separation at the receivers. 
Visible light communications are achieved by modulation of one or more spectral components in the visible spectrum ($\approx$400-800 nm). The use of this range provides an opportunity to exploit an otherwise untapped medium that is used in human lighting. Most visible light communication systems constructed to date focus on using a broad visible band generated by phosphor-converted blue light emitting diodes, or by filtering to isolate the blue components from these sources. Multi-wavelength systems consider multiple wavelength bands that are combined to produce the desired spectrum realizing a desired color temperature and intensity. The use of multiple bands is also a form of wavelength-division multiplexing. In this paper, we investigate the relationships between the colors comprising the lighting source for a range of lighting states, the spectral separation of communication channels, the relative intensities required to realize a lighting states, how modulation can be most effectively mapped to the available color channels, and the design of an optical filtering approach to maximize SNR while minimizing crosstalk at the receiver. Simulation results based on currently available light emitting diode sources and novel optical filters are shown using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing models.
