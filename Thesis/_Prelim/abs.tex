% ABSTRACT
In recent years, there has been a large--scale adoption of portable computing devices like smartphones and tablets. These along with internet-of-things need ubiquitous connectivity to the internet to provide value added services, maximize their functionality and create a `smart'-er world to live in. Cisco's visual networking index predicts wireless data consumption to increase by a cumulative rate of 61\% every year. This will put additional stress on the already stressed wireless access network infrastructure creating a phenomenon called `spectrum crunch'. 

On the other hand, solid state devices industry has made remarkable advances in energy efficient light-emitting-diodes (LED). The lighting industry is rapidly adopting LEDs to provide illumination in indoor spaces. Lighting fixtures are positioned to support human activities and thus are well located to act as wireless access points. The visible spectrum (380 nm -- 780 nm) is yet unregulated and untapped for wireless access. This provides unique opportunity to upgrade existing lighting infrastructure and create a dense grid of small cells by using this additional `optical' wireless bandwidth. Under the above model, lighting fixtures will service dual missions of illumination and wireless access points. 

This dissertation investigates multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) optical wireless broadcast system under unique constraints imposed by the optical channel and user illumination requirements. Sample indexed spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and metameric modulation are proposed to achieve higher spectral efficiency by exploiting dimensions of space and color respectively in addition to time and frequency dimensions. A framework is developed to analyze performance of imaging MIMO systems. Performance improvements for optical systems have been achieved by decorrelating spatially separate links by incorporating an imaging receiver. The dissertation also studies the impact of visual perception on performance color shift keying as specified in IEEE 802.15.7 standard. The dissertation then introduces the singular value decomposition based OWC system architecture to incorporate illumination constraints independent of communication constraints in a MIMO system. It then studies design paradigm for a multi--colored wavelength division multiplexed indoor OWC system.
