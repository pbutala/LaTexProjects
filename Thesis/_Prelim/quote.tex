``$\Delta$v - v for velocity, $\Delta$ for change. In space, this is the measure of change in velocity required to get from one place to another, thus a measure of the energy required to do it. Everything is moving already but to get something from the moving surface of the Earth into orbit around it requires a minimum $\Delta$v of 10 km/s. To leave Earth's orbit and fly to Mars requires a minimum $\Delta$v of 3.6 km/s and to orbit Mars and land on it requires a $\Delta$v of about 1 km/s. The hardest part is leaving Earth behind, for that is by far the deepest gravity well involved.''
