The primary purpose of a lighting device is to provide illumination in indoor spaces. Any value added services within the luminaire must not disrupt this primary function. Thus it is important to seamlessly integrate OWC techniques while maintaining illumination targets.

This chapter investigates design paradigms for spatial and multi--wavelength MIMO OWC systems. A singular value decomposition based OWC system is discussed to integrate illumination commands with spatial MIMO OWC \cite{but13a}. A multi--wavelength OWC system is then discussed to study the effect of change in system parameters on its performance \cite{but14c}.
