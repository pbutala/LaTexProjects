\chapter{Optical MIMO: Exploring the spatial dimension}
\label{chapter:mimoSpace}
\thispagestyle{myheadings}
The performance of an optical SISO channel is constrained by the low modulation bandwidth of LEDs. At the same time, a typical SISO optical channel operates at high SNR levels. Performance gains can be obtained by improving the modulation bandwidth of LEDs and/or by distributing the signal power across multiple dimensions of space, color, polarization etc. to create an optical MIMO channel.

This chapter explores the spatial dimension to create an optical MIMO channel. It investigates the imaging receiver to effectively decorrelate spatially separated sub--channels. A normalization framework for OWC systems with imaging receiver is then outlined. Significant performance enhancements for spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are shown by using an imaging receiver \cite{but14a}. Sample indexed spatial orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, a novel modulation technique that exploits the spatial dimension afforded by using multiple luminaires along with spectrally efficient optical OFDM, is then outlined \cite{but14b}.
