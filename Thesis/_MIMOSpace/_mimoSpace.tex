%This chapter explores the spatial dimension to create an optical MIMO channel. It investigates the imaging receiver to effectively decorrelate spatially separated sub--channels. A normalization framework for OWC systems with imaging receiver is then outlined. Significant performance enhancements for spatial modulation and spatial multiplexing are shown by using an imaging receiver \cite{but14a}. SIS-OFDM, a novel modulation technique the utilizes the spatial dimension afforded by using multiple luminaires is then outlined \cite{but14b}. It incorporates simplicity of SM along with spectral efficiency of O-OFDM into one optical MIMO modulation technique.

Spatial modulation (SM) and spatial multiplexing (SMP) are two MIMO techniques for transmitting data over an indoor optical wireless channel. Receivers for SM and SMP can be of the non--imaging type, in which case the channel matrix coefficients can be highly correlated, or of the imaging type, which can reduce the degree of correlation and improve overall system performance. In this chapter, we propose a novel framework to analyze the performance of imaging MIMO systems. This framework is applied to characterize the performance of SM and SMP under both imaging and non--imaging receivers. Results of our analysis indicate that imaging receivers can provide significant SNR improvements of up to 45 dB under SM and SMP as compared to the use of non--imaging receivers. Finally, the application of the proposed analysis framework indicates specific design principles to optimize imaging receiver parameters\footnote{This work is published in peer--reviewed IEEE conference proceeding \cite{but14a}.}.
