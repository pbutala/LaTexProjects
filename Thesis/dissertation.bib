  Abstract                 = {In this paper wireless communication using white, high brightness LEDs (light emitting diodes) is considered. In particular, the use of OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) for intensity modulation is investigated. The high peak-to-average ratio (PAR) in OFDM is usually considered a disadvantage in radio frequency transmission systems due to non-linearities of the power amplifier. It is demonstrated theoretically and by means of an experimental system that the high PAR in OFDM can be exploited constructively in visible light communication to intensity modulate LEDs. It is shown that the theoretical and the experimental results match very closely, and that it is possible to cover a distance of up to one meter using a single LED},
  Category                 = {OFDM},
  Conclusion               = {The experimental results validate the claim that intensity modulation using OFDM is indeed feasible; the high crest factor that plagues OFDM RF equipment is no longer a disadvantage. The prototype system has managed a distance close to one meter with an impressive bit error rate of 10^-3 under the moderate ambient light conditions found indoors. This distance has been achieved with a single LED and without any kind of channel or source coding - it is assumed that an array of similar LEDs with error correction coding would have a much higher intensity and achieve much greater distances with an even lower BER. The system performance curves also display a good match between the theoretical results and the experimental data. It is also clear that the system performance is ultimately dependent on the environment; the interference observed from the fluorescent lighting system can be easily mitigated by shifting the system bandwidth to a higher frequency. It is possible to further improve the system performance with a faster DSP, better data coding, a higher number of subcarriers, a larger FFT/IFFT, or any combination of these factors.},

  Abstract                 = { Performance of a diffuse optical link may potentially be degraded by temporal dispersions resulting from surface reflections. In order to devise techniques to alleviate the adverse effect of dispersion, an accurate channel model is needed. Obtaining the impulse response (IR) for a given receiver location requires consideration not only of the direct path, but also of reflections up to nth order. The IR is only valid for a specific location and specific receiver parameters. If a receiver moves, the IR has to be recalculated. We propose a new approach for characterizing diffuse links that results in a tremendous saving in calculation and also gives more insight into the channel characteristics. The new approach is based on consolidating the dependence of receiver parameters, transmitter parameters, and the indoor environment into independent components. Thus, changing one of the parameters of the link requires recalculation of one of these components. The new model is utilized to obtain an accurate profile of delay spread and received power throughout a room.},
  Category                 = {MIMO},
  Conclusion               = {In this paper, a new representation of indoor optical link is introduced. The representation divides the physical path between a transmitter and a receiver into stages. Each stage consolidates a set of parameters upon which an impulse response depends. This results in a tremendous saving in calculation, especially when only one of the parameters is changed, such as location of a transmitter or a receiver.
 The new representation enables us to calculate received power per reflection for a very high order of reflections. It is shown that the received power falls sharply with every new reflection. This justifies the consideration of the first few reflections when calculating an impulse response. Temporal dispersion caused by multipath is one of the factors that limits achievable bit rate over a diffuse link. Through efficient calculation of impulse response, delay spread and received power profiles were generated. Both are obtained from channel IR. The matrix PSI is calculated and stored in a file and is used to calculate impulse response at each new location. The time required to calculate PSI is comparable to that required to calculate a single impulse response. Once PSI is obtained, the calculation of a new impulse response requires less than 30 seconds.},

  Abstract                 = { Spatial confinement of the paths traveled by infrared signals enables reuse of bandwidth and resources in adjacent indoor environments. This property can also result in undesirable shadowing that occurs whenever an obstacle blocks signal paths between transceivers. Shadowing compromises link reliability by increasing the error rate, and can result in service interruption. We propose spatial coding to improve link performance and alleviate the shadowing effect in multi spot diffusing, a multi-input, multi-output architecture. Spatial coding performance is compared to receiver multi-level combining. Our results show that when a channel is shadowed, 4-level combining at the receiver fails to maintain a reliable link irrespective of transmitted power. Using spatial coding over 6 channels, a reliable link is possible in the presence of a shadowed channel with an optical power penalty of 4.5 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we introduce two novel methods (beam power adaptation and diversity imaging) to the design of optical wireless systems to improve link performance. The aim is to reduce the effect of intersymbol interference and to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thus enabling the system to achieve mobility while operating at high bit rates. In good agreement with previous work, the results show that the imaging conventional diffuse system (CDS) with maximum ratio combining (MRC) offers 20 dB better SNR than the nonimaging CDS. The new adaptive line strip multibeam system (ALSMS) with a new imaging diversity receiver provides an SNR improvement of 39 dB over the imaging diversity CDS when both systems employ MRC and operate at 30 Mbits/s. This result illustrates the SNR improvement achieved through the use of our adaptive algorithm coupled with spot diffusing. The lower bit rate (30 Mbits/s) facilitates comparison with previous work. The results also indicate that the combination of transmit power adaptation and spot diffusing coupled with imaging diversity receivers can enable fully mobile 2.5 Gbit/s optical wireless communication. Such a 2.5 Gbit/s system (imaging MRC ALSMS) achieved an SNR improvement of 27 dB over a lower data rate (30 Mbits/s) nonimaging CDS.},
  Category                 = {MIMO},
  Conclusion               = {In this paper, we introduced three approaches (transmit power adaptation, spot diffusing, and imaging diversity reception) to the design of OW systems to improve the system’s performance in the presence of BN, multipath dispersion, and mobility. At a bit rate of 30 Mbits/s, the CDS SNR performance improves by 20 dB when the single imaging MRC receiver replaces the nonimaging receiver. This result agrees very well with that reported in [17]. A further SNR improvement of 8 dB (in the imaging CDS system) is achieved when our imaging diversity MRC receiver is implemented instead of the single imaging MRC receiver. Simulation results indicate that the combination of transmit power adaptation and spot diffusing (i.e., ALSMS) coupled with imaging diversity MRC reception produces an SNR improvement of 39 dB over the imaging diversity MRC CDS when both systems operate at a bit rate of 30 Mbits/s and at a transmitter–receiver separation of 6 m. This result is the consequence of two effects. First, assigning higher power levels adaptively to the spots nearest to the receiver results in a strong received power. Second, a reduction in the ambient-induced shot noise and preamplifier thermal noise is observed due to the small pixel size and its associated narrow FOV. The results also show that an SNR gain of 23 dB is achieved when our proposed system (imaging diversity MRC ALSMS) replaces the imaging diversity LSMS with MRC again at a 6 m transmitter–receiver distance and a data rate of 30 Mbits/s illustrating the gain achieved through adaptation.

The power consumed by the proposed system is relatively low and the transmit power can be significantly reduced below the current 1 Watt level by making use of the SNR improvements achieved at the bit rates considered. In order to achieve a BER of 10^-9, the SNR has to be 15.6 dB for conventional OOK systems. Therefore, at the worst communication path considered in the 30 Mbit/s OOK systems, the combination of the spot-diffusing geometry and imaging diversity reception with MRC can reduce the transmit power by almost 10 dB while achieving 10^-9 BER. A further reduction in the transmit power requirement of 12 dB approximately can be achieved when the beam power adaptation method is implemented. As such, in our proposed systems, the power required in each beam is relatively low and can also be transmitted in compliance with eye safety regulations. Furthermore, the system makes use of commercially available components and can therefore be implemented at relatively low cost.

These SNR improvements are also coupled with a significant reduction in delay spread, i.e., increase in channel bandwidth. These improvements can enable the OW system to achieve mobility while operating at high bit rates (2.5 Gbits/s). Our proposed system (imaging diversity MRC ALSMS) is evaluated at a high bit rate of 2.5 Gbits/s and an SNR improvement of 27 dB is observed compared to a lower data rate (30 Mbits/s) nonimaging CDS at a 6 m transmitter–receiver horizontal separation.},

  Abstract                 = {Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation technique which is now used in most new and emerging broadband wired and wireless communication systems because it is an effective solution to intersymbol interference caused by a dispersive channel. Very recently a number of researchers have shown that OFDM is also a promising technology for optical communications. This paper gives a tutorial overview of OFDM highlighting the aspects that are likely to be important in optical applications. To achieve good performance in optical systems OFDM must be adapted in various ways. The constraints imposed by single mode optical fiber, multimode optical fiber and optical wireless are discussed and the new forms of optical OFDM which have been developed are outlined. The main drawbacks of OFDM are its high peak to average power ratio and its sensitivity to phase noise and frequency offset. The impairments that these cause are described and their implications for optical systems discussed.},
  Category                 = {Tutorial OFDM},
  Conclusion               = {This paper presents a tutorial introduction to OFDM. A typical OFDM transmitter and receiver are described and the roles of the main signal processing blocks explained. The time and frequency domain signals at various points in the system are described. It is shown that if a cyclic prefix is added to each OFDM symbol, any linear distortion introduced by the channel can be equalized by a single tap equalizer. This process is explained by considering the effect of a simple two-path channel on the component of the transmitted signal due to one subcarrier frequency. Throughout the description particular emphasis is given to those aspects of an OFDM system that are often misunderstood.

Although the theoretical basis for OFDM was laid several decades ago, and OFDM became the basis of many communications standards for wireless and wired applications in the 1990’s, it is only very recently that the application of OFDM to optical communication has been considered. This is partly because of the apparent incompatibility between OFDM modulation and conventional optical systems. A number of forms of OFDM which overcome these incompatibilities in various ways have been developed for a variety of optical applications. These are classified into those appropriate for optical wireless and multimode fiber applications and those for single mode fiber. For the former, intensity modulation should be used, while for the latter the OFDM signal should be carried on the field of optical signal.

OFDM has a number of drawbacks including its high peak-toaverage power ratio and sensitivity to frequency offset and phase noise. These are described and their likely implications for optical communications discussed. 

In conclusion, OFDM is a very promising technology for optical communications, but the very different constraints introduced open up many new interesting avenues for research.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile optical communications has so far largely been limited to short ranges of about ten meters, since the highly directional nature of optical transmissions would require costly mechanical steering mechanisms. Advances in CCD and CMOS imaging technology along with the advent of visible and infrared (IR) light sources such as (light emitting diode) LED arrays presents an exciting and challenging concept which we call as visual-MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) where optical transmissions by multiple transmitter elements are received by an array of photodiode elements (e.g. pixels in a camera). Visual-MIMO opens a new vista of research challenges in PHY, MAC and Network layer research and this paper brings together the networking, communications and computer vision elds to discuss the feasibility of this as well as the underlying opportunities and challenges. Example applications range from household/factory robotic to tactical to vehicular networks as well pervasive computing, where RF communications can be interference-limited and prone to eavesdropping and security lapses while the less observable nature of highly directional optical transmissions can be benecial. The impact of the characteristics of such technologies on the medium access and network layers has so far received little consideration. Example characteristics are a strong reliance on computer vision algorithms for tracking, a form of interference cancellation that allows successfully receiving packets from multiple transmitters simultaneously, and the absence of fast fading but a high susceptibility to outages due to line-of-sight interruptions. These characteristics lead to signicant challenges and opportunities for mobile networking research.},

  Conclusion               = {This paper presents the design and development of highspeed indoor optical wireless MIMO-OFDM system that uses an imaging receiver. At 100cm range 220Mbps transmission is achieved by combining both channels. The system has a coverage of 8cm x 9.7cm.

The transmission rate is constrained by the low LED bandwidth (~2MHz). Improvements can be made by using an LED with higher bandwidth, equalisation, or by adding a blue filter to block the slow phosphor component at the receiver. A bit-rate of up to 230Mbps/channel has been demonstrated in a single-input single-output (SISO)-OFDM system [24] so there is potential for further improvement.

The high-speed system has a limited coverage area at present. This is limited by the optical power available from the LEDs, as increased coverage requires a greater LED beam divergence. In addition the sources need to be spaced more widely and the receiver optical system redesigned (the system demonstrated in [16] achieves a coverage of ~80x80cm using a greater beam divergence but the much lower level of illumination limits the bit rate to 2Mbps/channel). Further work is required to increase both transmission power and coverage and this is underway.},

If we avoid the unnecessary digital apparatus we shall get closer to a real-time communication system. However this happens usually at the expense of bandwidth extension and/or power growth. Fortunately the optical hunk fiber offers a very wide transmission band - e.g. 2 GHz - with low attenuation and distortion.

Much work in this area has attempted to fit VLC into currently dominant indoor lighting modes, which broadcast the light in a wide field to achieve uniform coverage throughout a room. In this paper we explore spotlighting, which is appropriate lighting for many scenarios, as an alternative for implementing high datarate VLC. We find that spotlighting VLC has several benefits over uniform lighting implementations, including enabling higher datarate densities within a room and less channel distortion. We also introduce a hybrid scheme that combines spotlighting with uniform lighting to provide wide area data coverage as well as high-datarate #x201C;white hot spots #x201D; where needed.},

The hOME Gigabit Access (OMEGA) HAN project [1] aims at bridging the gap between home and access network, providing Gbit/s connectivity to users. The project considers a combination of various technologies such as radio frequency (RF) and free-space or wireless optical links (FSO - operating at infrared and visible wavelengths) in order to meet user demands and provide wireless connectivity within and the home and its surroundings. When combined with power-line communications this enables a home backbone that meets the ldquowithout new wiresrdquo vision. A technology-independent MAC layer will control this network and provide services as well as connectivity to any number of devices the user wishes to connect to it in any room in a house/apartment, and further, this MAC layer will allow the service to follow the user from device to device.

We then propose a novel modulation scheme for visible light communications which can maintain constant perceived ambient lighting. By using D>;3 LEDs, multiple lighting states that are indistinguishable to humans but are distinguishable to an electronic receiver can be achieved. Changes between these states are detected as intensity modulation in different wavelength bands.},

  Abstract                 = {Optical spatial modulation (OSM) is a multiple-transmitter technique that can provide higher data rates with low system complexity as compared with single-input single-output systems. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely implemented to achieve better spectral efficiency in wireless channels. Asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (O-OFDM) and DC-biased O-OFDM are two well-known O-OFDM techniques suitable for intensity-modulation direct-detection optical systems. In this work, sample indexed spatial OFDM (SIS-OFDM) is proposed to combine OSM and O-OFDM in a novel way and achieve significant performance gain. By assigning time-domain samples of the O-OFDM transmit symbol to different transmitters, SIS-OFDM achieves much better spectral efficiency and reduces computational complexity at the transmitter as compared with previous work that combines OSM with O-OFDM in the frequency domain. We also consider the impact of optical source biasing on overall performance, and the relative performance of imaging receiver (ImR) versus non-imaging receiver (NImR) design for our proposed SIS-OFDM technique. Results indicate that for an Ntx {\texttimes} Nrx multiple-input multiple-output configuration where Ntx $=$ Nrx $=$ 4, SIS-OFDM using ImR can achieve up to 135 dB of signal-to-noise ratio gain over comparable system using a NImR. Also, using Nsc number of O-OFDM subcarriers provides up to Nsc {\texttimes} log2(Ntx) additional bits per symbol of spectral efficiency over techniques that combine OSM and O-OFDM in the frequency domain.},

Receivers for SM and SMP can be of the non-imaging type, in which case the channel matrix coefficients can be highly correlated, or of the imaging type, which can reduce the degree of correlation and improve overall system performance. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the performance of imaging MIMO systems. This framework is applied to characterize the performance of SM and SMP under both imaging and non-imaging receivers. Results of our analysis indicate that imaging receivers can provide significant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvements up to 45dB under SM and SMP as compared to the use of non-imaging receivers. Finally, the application of the proposed analysis framework indicates specific design principles to optimize imaging receiver parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Visible light communication (VLC) is achieved by modulation of one or more spectral components in the visible spectrum (~380-780 nm). The use of this range provides an opportunity to exploit an otherwise untapped medium that is used in human lighting. Most VLC systems constructed to date focus on using a broad visible band generated by phosphor-converted light emitting diodes, or by filtering to isolate the blue component from these sources. Multi-wavelength systems consider additional wavelength bands that are combined to produce the desired communications capacity and lighting output. This color combining, or mixing, realizes desired color temperature and intensity and represents a form of wavelength-division multiplexing. This paper investigates the relationships between the colors comprising the lighting source for a range of lighting states, the spectral separation of communication channels, the relative intensities required to realize lighting states, how modulation can be most effectively mapped to the available color channels, and the design of an optical filtering approach to maximize signal to noise ratio while minimizing crosstalk at the receiver. Simulation results based on a three colored VLC system are discussed using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing for each color. It is shown that the system is the most power efficient at 6250 K correlated color temperature, with transmitter spectral spread of 5 nm and filter transmittance width of 40 nm.},

  Abstract                 = {We outline the benefits and challenges of using angle diversity in nondirected wireless infrared (IR) communications systems. Multiple transmitter beams and multiple narrow field-of view receivers reduce the path loss, multipath distortion, and background noise of the channel, which leads to improved range. We also discuss practical considerations for multielement angle diversity systems, including channel characterization and suboptimal detection techniques. Maximal-ratio combining provides nearly optimal performance up to 100 Mb/s for the angle diversity systems considered. The design and performance of a prototype angle diversity IR communication system are discussed. The prototype can maintain 70 Mb/s at a Pe of 10-9 over a 4-m range},
  Category                 = {Diversity},
  Conclusion               = {Multiple transmit beams and narrow FOV receiver elements can improve the performance of nondirected wireless IR links. This performance improvement is due to the reduction in background noise and from reduced multipath distortion in such systems. The improvement is manifested in all of the metrics considered here—reduced delay spread, increased SNR, increased power margin for room coverage, and increased range. Vertically oriented systems are ideal at high data rates when range is the primary consideration. They are best suited when LOS links are apt to be blocked. They are also useful in very large rooms where one cannot cover the entire room with a single transmitter and so one would need to use multiple transmitters in a cellular pattern. The rapid drop in SNR that these systems exhibit is a benefit in this context as intercell interference will be reduced. The horizontally oriented systems, which employ multiple directed horizontal beams, provide the best power margin for covering medium-sized rooms. However, they rely on an LOS path for successful operation. The prototype nondirected IR system achieves a 4.2-m range at 70 Mb/s. The improvements in performance predicted by analysis are also exhibited by this prototype, and the method for parametric estimation of the combiner tap weights with lowcomplexity hardware implementation was successfully demonstrated. The primary problem with the receivers described in this paper is the size of the optical elements required, although alternative concentrators exist [17] that have better size versus gain characteristics. Another possible approach would be to use a single lens-based imaging receiver [5] rather than a collection of separate nonimaging concentrators.},

The power efficiencies of modulation schemes are compared at 30 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s over an ensemble of experimentally determined multipath channels. Carrier selection and power shaping are examined as methods for improving MSM performance. It is found that MSM schemes can allow operation at higher data rates than single-carrier modulation schemes without equalization. Moreover, MSM schemes can be more bandwidth-efficient and also can provide a simple and flexible method for multiple access to the channel. However, they are not as power efficient as single-carrier schemes, and this will limit their use to applications which are not power limited},

  Abstract                 = {With the recent development of solid-state lighting (SSL) technologies, visible light communication (VLC) systems using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has been a promising technology to complement wireless communication. While LEDs offers advantageous properties such as high brightness, lower power consumption, long lifetime, and short transient time for high transmission rates, few researches have been exploited on the receiver side. Conventionally, photoelectric-diodes are implemented to convert optical signals into electronic signals. Since conventional photoelectric-diodes cannot distinguish inputs of different spectra, using conventional photoelectric-diodes have the disadvantage that the system is vulnerable to interference, and that it is hard to achieve wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) for light sources of different wavelengths. In this work, a spectrum sensor array is proposed to be implemented on the receiver side to achieve interference rejection. Due to recent advances in semiconductor technologies, spectrum sensors with different spectral transmission properties can be integrated into a chip-scale sensor-array. By proper design of the weightings for individual spectrum sensor, the effective output signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) can be maximized. Following the concept of coherent multi-antenna communication systems, signal fusion algorithms are presented. Our simulation is conducted based on the specification of a prototype filter-array spectrum sensor from nanoLambda. Simulation results demonstrate that robust interference rejection is possible using the low-cost spectrum sensor array.},

Using a detailed analysis of the clipped signal, our recent work focused on reducing this clipping-resulted dc via both power optimization and frequency planning. In this paper, a set of effective receiver signal-to-noise ratio formulas is proposed, which helps in accurately and efficiently evaluating the system performance across various optical OFDM systems. We conduct a power efficiency analysis to reveal tradeoffs between power and spectral efficiencies among different systems. Our results show that with a cost of additional complexity, a diversity-combining technique offers significant benefits in all cases.},

A union upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) is derived and the performance characteristics are then discussed with a variety of system parameters. Furthermore, fuzzy logic (FL) control is proposed to provide tolerance of different degrees of reliability in multirate transmission and to achieve distinct service differentiation for multimedia applications.

The work done in this paper constitute a step towards the practical implementation of such links, since it is the first time the effects of spatial transformations are considered. Signal magnification introduces varying spatial frequency inter-channel interference (SF-ICI) at the receiver. A novel receiver design that uses complex windowing with decision feedback equalization is used to equalize the SF-ICI in spatial frequency domain. For SF-ICI limited channels, the novel receiver design achieved a low bit-error rate (BER) compared with rectangular windowing with bin-by-bin detection. However, for noise limited channels, rectangular windowing with bin-by-bin detections is the receiver design of choice.},
  Category                 = {MIMO Rcvr},
  Conclusion               = {In this work, the receiver design for wireless optical MIMO channels with magnification was considered. The novelty of this work arise in the consideration of spatial transformations in optical MIMO channels. A model that encompass the effects of magnification and rotation on continuous-tone SDMT modulated frames was derived. From the model, it was shown that magnification and rotation cause spatial frequency varying inter-channel interference. Windowing is introduced as an effective method to contain the SF-ICI in a band of neighboring frequencies. To equalize the SF-ICI introduced by magnification, two equalization techniques were proposed. The first technique relies on bin-by-bin detection with rectangular windowing. The second technique relies on a DFE with a novel complex window design. The choice of an equalization technique depends on the channel magnification, as well as the frame size. For magnification values where the channel is limited by the SF-ICI, decision feedback equalization with a complex window is the receiver design of choice. However, when the channel is noise limited, i.e. the SF-ICI is negligible, bin-by-bin detection with rectangular windowing is the best design in terms of low bit-error rate.
 It is important to mention that the performance of the DFE is limited by the design of the windowing function. In this work, heuristic methods where used to design the windowing function. In future work, a more rigorous design must be performed to minimize the biterror rate. Another possible future work, is to extended decision feedback equalizer with windowing to overcome the effects of rotation in the channel. The development of these detection methods could pave the way towards the practical implementation of wireless optical MIMO communication links in many applications.},

  Conclusion               = {This letter reports the design and development of an indoor optical wireless MIMO system that uses an imaging receiver. MIMO signal processing allows different transmitter signals to be recovered, and the system shows error-free operation at 2 Mbit/s/channel at the center of the coverage area, with worse performance away from the center. The demonstration shows the potential of this technique, and that the simple geometric design techniques set out in [11] yield a working system. Similarly the relatively simple signal recovery techniques used in this letter have been verified in an experimental environment with typical available components, indicating channels are highly stable. Further work will focus on improving the levels of illumination (at present 15 to 20 lux, compared with 400 lux in a typical room), improved signal processing, and investigation of the relationship between SNR, matrix condition number and overall BER.
 Solid state lighting is likely to become the standard for new illumination installations over the next fewyears, and the imaging MIMO approach offers the potential to use this for high data rate transmission as well as illumination, by exploiting the inherent parallel nature of LED based illumination.},

Among the many transmission principles that exploit multiple-antenna at either the transmitter, the receiver, or both, Spatial Modulation (SM) is a novel and recently proposed multiple-antenna transmission technique that can offer, with a very low system complexity, improved data rates compared to Single-Input- Single-Output (SISO) systems, and robust error performance even in correlated channel environments. SM is an entirely new modulation concept that exploits the uniqueness and randomness properties of the wireless channel for communication. This is achieved by adopting a simple but effective coding mechanism that establishes a one-to-one mapping between blocks of information bits to be transmitted and the spatial positions of the transmit-antenna in the antenna-array. In this article, we summarize the latest research achievements and outline some relevant open research issues of this recently proposed transmission technique.},

It is shown that the DCO-OFDM component causes no interference on the odd frequency subcarriers so the receiver processing for the ACO-OFDM signal is identical to a conventional ACO-OFDM system. The ACO-OFDM signal causes clipping noise which falls on the even subcarriers. However, this interference can be estimated and cancelled at the receiver. The cancellation process results in a 3 dB noise penalty in the DCO-OFDM component. Simulation results are presented for an additive white Gaussian noise channel and it is shown that the new technique can achieve better optical power performance than the conventional schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) is a technology developed for high data rate vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Accurate estimation of speed of a vehicular node is essential in applications of WAVE such as collision avoidance systems and intersection safety applications. A novel speed estimation technique in WAVE is presented in this paper. The method estimates the relative speed of a vehicle using the Doppler shift which causes frequency offset in the received orthogonal frequency division multiplexed subcarriers. The frequency offset in the received subcarriers is calculated using a cross correlation metric between the transmitted pilot subcarriers and the received pilot subcarriers. The method gives good estimates of relative speed even at low signal to noise ratios and the simulations demonstrate that wide range of speeds (0 to 360 km/h) can be accurately estimated.},

This paper addresses both line-of-sight (LOS) and nonline-of-sight (non-LOS) IR links. We quantify link performance in terms of the transmitter power required to achieve a bit error rate (BER) not exceeding 10-9 with 95% probability. Our results indicate that in LOS links, imaging receivers can reduce the required transmitter power by up to 13 dB compared to single-element receivers. In non-LOS links, imaging receivers and multibeam transmitters can reduce the required transmitter power by more than 20 dB. Furthermore we discuss the use of multibeam transmitters and imaging receivers to implement space-division multiple access (SDMA). In a representative example with two users transmitting at a power sufficient to achieve a BER not exceeding 10-9 with 95% probability in the absence of cochannel interference, when SDMA is employed, the system can achieve a BER not exceeding 10-9 with a probability of about 88%},

The LED transfer function distorts the signal amplitude and forces the lower peaks to be clipped at the LED turn-on voltage. Additionally, the upper peaks are purposely clipped before modulating the LED to avoid chip overheating. The induced distortion can be controlled by optimizing the bias point or backing-off the average O-OFDM signal power. In this letter, a model that incorporates amplitude distortion and that provides a parameterized upper clipping is proposed. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the model can be used to determine the optimum bias point and to optimize the O-OFDM signal power. In this context, a novel concept of soft-clipping of the upper peaks is presented. It is shown that soft-clipping is an effective approach to reduce nonlinearity distortion and to enhance symbol error performance.},

Although it is known that the capacity-achieving input distribution is discrete with a finite number of mass points, finding it requires complex non-linear optimization at every SNR. In this work, a simple expression for a capacity-approaching distribution is derived via source entropy maximization. The resulting mutual information using the derived discrete non-uniform input distribution is negligibly far away from the channel capacity. The computation of this distribution is substantially less complex than previous optimization approaches and can be easily computed at different SNRs. A practical algorithm for non-uniform optical intensity signalling is presented using multi-level coding followed by a mapper and multi-stage decoding at the receiver. The proposed signalling is simulated on free-space optical channels and outage capacity is analyzed. A significant gain in both rate and probability of outage is achieved compared to uniform signalling, especially in the case of channels corrupted by fog.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we compare the performance of multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) techniques applied to indoor optical wireless communications (OWC) assuming line-ofsight (LOS) channel conditions. Specifically, several 4 × 4 setups with different transmitter spacings and different positions of the receiver array are considered. The following MIMO algorithms are considered: Repetition Coding (RC), Spatial Multiplexing (SMP) and Spatial Modulation (SM). Particularly, we develop a framework to analytically approximate the bit error ratios (BERs) of these schemes and verify the theoretical bounds by simulations. The results show that due to diversity gains, RC is robust to various transmitter-receiver alignments. However, as RC does not provide spatial multiplexing gains, it requires large signal constellation sizes to enable high spectral efficiencies. In contrast, SMP enables high data rates by exploiting multiplexing gains. In order to provide these gains, SMP needs sufficiently low channel correlation. SM is a combined MIMO and digital modulation technique. We show that SM is more robust to high channel correlation compared to SMP, while enabling larger spectral efficiency compared to RC. Moreover, we investigate the effect of induced power imbalance between the multiple transmitters. It is found that power imbalance can substantially improve the performance of both SMP and SM as it reduces channel correlation. In this context, we also show that blocking some of the links is an acceptable method to reduce channel correlation. Even though the blocking diminishes the received energy, it outweighs this degradation by providing improved channel conditions for SMP and SM. For example, blocking 4 of the 16 links of the 4 × 4 setup improves the BER performance of SMP by more than 20 dB, while the effective signal to noise ratio (SNR) is reduced by about 2 dB due to the blocking. Therefore, MIMO techniques can provide gains even under LOS conditions which - rovide only little channel differences.},

Because RC is known to achieve very good performance in OWC systems due to the use of intensity modulation and the resulting constructive superposition of the power signals. The results show that SM can outperform RC when high spectral efficiencies are desirable, e.g. 4 bit/s/Hz and greater, since it can operate with reduced signal modulation orders by conveying additional data bits in the spatial domain. We also demonstrate that SM benefits from receive-diversity to a larger extent while at the same time requiring less computational complexity. Furthermore, we give a general framework to numerically approximate the average bit error probability of both SM and RC.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper a novel multiple antenna transmission technique, named spatial modulation (SM) is proposed. Here SM is applied to OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transmission. In SM the transmit antenna number is used as an explicit source of information. SM maps a block of information bits to an information symbol and to a particular transmit antenna such that the same information symbol transmitted from different antennas conveys different information. At each time instant, only the corresponding transmit antenna will be radiating signal power on a particular OFDM sub-carrier, while all other transmit antennas transmit zero power. Consequently, inter-channel interference (ICI) at the receiver input and the need for antenna synchronization are completely avoided. A comparative analysis is made on the performance of SM and V-BLAST (Vertical Bell Labs Layered Space-Time) algorithm assuming Rician fading channel, spatial correlation (SC) and mutual coupling (MC). It is shown that at a BER (bit error ratio) of 10-3, SM outperforms V-BLAST by 5 dB in the presence of Rician fading and by 7 dB in the presence of spatial correlation and mutual coupling for 6 bits/symbol/sub-carrier transmission.},

  Conclusion               = {Diffuse optical links provide a more secure alternative to traditional RF systems by providing a tightly contained wireless coverage area. By applying MIMO space-time coding to diffuse optical communication links, we can utilize the various multipath components to reduce the CBEP, thereby increasing the achievable data rate. Using our experimental testbed, we verified our MIMO space-time code to show a proof-of-concept diffuse optical MIMO wireless link providing a secure picocellular coverage area with a 7-foot radius. We demonstrated that the application of our 2 x 2 MIMO STC outperforms both the SISO and MISO configurations. Further research in this area will consider the impact of different transceiver array geometries (spacing, orientation, and so forth), error-correcting codes, and adaptive power control on the performance of the MIMO free-space optical link.},

  Abstract                 = {An adaptive orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system is proposed for multi-user communications over indoor wireless optical channels. The designed system uses multi-user least-squares detection techniques applied to space-division multiple access and OFDM schemes, in conjunction with angle-diversity reception. The system, which does not present an excessive increase in complexity with respect to the previous schemes, can support high bit rates for multiple users, beyond 100 Mbits/s. It also mitigates the channel fluctuations induced when either the space distribution or the number of emitters and receivers varies. The performance of the new proposed scheme is compared with that of a non-adaptive multi-user system and an adaptive single-user system, both described in the previous works, when they face similar environmental situations. The obtained results show a significant enhancement with respect to both the previous multi-user system and the adaptive single-user one, since the new scheme allows adaptively managing the system throughput on a multi-user environment},

  Abstract                 = {Code-division multiple-access (CDMA) has flourished as a successful wireless networking technology in mobile cellular telephony, and wireless local area networks (LAN) such as the unlicensed industry, science, and medicine (ISM) bands. The commercial exploitation of the benefits of CDMA raises the question as to whether optical code-based communications offer significant benefits to an optical network and what are the technologies that enable code-based optical networks. Recent investigations of optical CDMA (OCDMA) strategies have addressed this question through numerous laboratory-based test-bed studies of multiuser link and recent experimental field trials conducted on in-the-ground fiber. OCDMA requires its own physical layer technologies that are distinctly different from widely pursued wavelength-division-multiplexed (WDM) all-optical networks. Simulations of multiuser performance predict ultimate link capacity and the performance of broadcast and select synchronous nets with strong central management as well as asynchronous architectures with reduced centralized management.},

  Abstract                 = {Short-range wireless optical channels provide high-data rate indoor links free of spectral licensing issues. In this work, we present a point-to-point, multiple-input/multiple output (MIMO) optical channel, termed the pixelated wireless optical channel, which exploits the inherent spatial diversity of the channel to achieve gains in spectral efficiency. Information is conveyed through the transmission of a series of pixelated images to a receiver array. An experimental prototype point-to-point link is constructed using a 512 times; 512 pixel LCD panel and 154 times; 154 pixels of a CCD camera. Based on channel measurements, a channel model amenable to computer simulation is developed. Spatial discrete multitone modulation is proposed for this MIMO wireless optical channel to combat the low pass spatial response of the channel. The capacity of a given channel realization is estimated by way of the water-pouring spectrum. Multi-level coding and multi-stage decoding over the spatial frequency bins is shown to yield spectral efficiencies of approximately 1.7 kbit/s/Hz over a range of 2 m.},

  Conclusion               = {The pixelated wireless optical channel provides large gains in spectral efficiency by leveraging the spatial diversity inherent to arrays of optical emitters and detectors. The increase in spectral efficiency is achieved through spatio-temporal coding which replaces the inefficient spatial repetition code of conventional multi-element wireless optical links.
 Although spatially invariant channels are discussed here, SDMT may also be appropriate on channels with spatial variation. It is often the case in chip-to-chip optical signalling that the gain of pixels may vary across the array or even be zero. If the spatial variation was known a priori at the transmitter, say during a calibration stage in manufacture, it can be taken into account in the power allocation algorithm. It should also be noted that the pixelated transmitter and receiver need not be planar. Indeed, hemispherical or other shaped transmitters may be convenient in practical situations and relieve the orientation problem inherent to point-to-point links. Such non-planar transmitters can be fabricated using OLED panels. Additionally, practical pixelated links can also be implemented in the infrared band using proper transmitter and receiver arrays.},

  Abstract                 = { In multispot-diffuse multiple-input-multiple-output (MSD-MIMO) system configuration, a communications channel can be considered virtually ideal at data rates of hundreds of megabits per second. Thus, the main concern is power efficiency. We propose a transceiver optical design that creates a reconfigurable transmitter output and independent communications channels. The transmitter employs multiple light sources that can be turned on and off, independently. In this way, an optical signal is provided only where it is needed. The receiver utilizes an imaging optical system and a segmented photodetector, thus performing direction diversity reception. We show that when maximum ratio combining is employed on the received electric signals and power-efficient modulation schemes such as L-level pulse-position modulation are used, significant power savings can be achieved. We also investigate the vulnerability of MSD-MIMO links to shadowing and blockage and their effects on communications cell size and required transmit power in a cellular configuration.},
  Category                 = {MIMO},
  Conclusion               = {A vital factor that affects the quality of service in indoor optical wireless communication systems is their vulnerability to shadowing and blockage. An opaque object can partially shadow or completely block an optical link, because infrared light does not penetrated opaque barriers.
 Based on considerations about blockage caused by sitting people, we have concluded that the maximum radiation angle at the transmitter should not exceed 45 , which restricts the communication cell size. In this case, MSD-MIMO links are robust against blockage, although still vulnerable to shadowing. However, in a typical office having a height of 3 m, the probability of shadowing caused by standing people is less than 2% and, in the majority of the shadowed cases, the shadowing causes less than 50% reduction in the received signal power. The power penalty due to shadowing is insignificant (less than 0.1 dB in 99% of the cases).
 MSD-MIMO links are virtually free from multipath dispersion; therefore, they have great potentials for high-speed communications. Yet a major issue is the poor power efficiency that is characteristic to all nonline-of-sight links.
 We propose a reconfigurable transceiver design that reduces the required transmit power. This is achieved by introducing multiple light sources at the transmitter that can be turned on and off independently, according to the instantaneous needs, thus creating independent communication channels, and by using an imaging receiver with a pixelated photodetector for direction diversity detection. The optimal receiver FOV is deduced by considerations about link blockage and optical noise reception.
 In MSD-MIMO configurations, a user terminal communicates with the base station through several communication channels with uncorrelated noise. This allows for a maximum-ratiocombining technique to be employed, so that the output SNR is significantly increased and power requirements are lowered accordingly. 
 Virtually unlimited channel bandwidth in MSD-MIMO links allows for power efficient signaling schemes such as L-PPM to be utilized. This brings the required average transmit power down to approximately 0 dBm per laser source in the transmitter VCSEL array at 200 Mb/s, even after considering a link power budget margin of approximately 2 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple analytical model of the wireless infrared communication channel in indoor environments is presented. The infrared signal is modeled as the combination of a diffuse component and a line-of-sight (LOS) or direct component. For the diffuse component alone, the properties of the channel are found using Ulbricht's integrating sphere. When a LOS component is also present, the transfer function depends upon the Rician factor K given by the ratio of the electrical power in the LOS and diffuse signals after the detector. For small K, the transfer function shows notches down to low frequencies, but due to the nature of light never for zero frequency. We confirm that a K-factor ?13 dB is required also in infrared wireless links in order to support distortionless data transmission beyond 100 Mbit/s. Increasing the directivity at the receiver and/or at the transmitter improves the effective value of K. Here, we show that a moderate directivity will be sufficient for high-speed infrared communication in typical indoor scenarios},

In line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight links, replacement of a single-element receiver by one employing an imaging light concentrator and a segmented photodetector can reduce received ambient light noise and multipath distortion. For a fixed receiver entrance area, such an imaging receiver can reduce transmit power requirements by as much as about 14 dB, depending on the link design and the number of photodetector segments. Imaging receivers also reduce co-channel interference, and may therefore enable infrared wireless networks to employ space-division multiplexing, wherein several transmitters located in close proximity can transmit simultaneously at the same wavelength. In nondirected non-line-of-sight links, replacement of the diffuse transmitter by one that projects multiple narrow beams can reduce the path loss, further reducing the transmit power requirement by several decibels.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the unregulated bandwidth available in wireless optical channels is exploited to reduce the average optical power in multiple-subcarrier modulated (MSM) systems. Data transmission is confined to a bandwidth located near DC, while out-of-band subcarrier signals are designed outside the data bandwidth to reduce the average optical power. Although the out-of-band signals at higher frequency are subject to severe corruption induced by multipath distortion, they are removed at the receiver and not used for detection. Optimizing the out-of-band carrier amplitudes over the set of real numbers yields gains as high as 2.6 dB over conventional MSM systems at the same bandwidth efficiency. We additionally apply in-band trellis coding and out-of-band signals, whose amplitudes are optimized over a discrete constellation. When no out-of-band signals are used, the system achieves an average optical power reduction of 0.9 dB over uncoded systems with a simultaneous peak power reduction of 0.4 dB. An additional average optical power reduction of 0.9 dB is realized at the expense of 4 out-of-band carriers and a moderate increase in peak power.},

  Abstract                 = {As we step further into the 21st century, the demand for sustainable energy-efficient technology grows higher. The important area of electric lighting, currently dominated by decades-old incandescent and fluorescent sources, is being taken over by white light emitting diodes, which are solid state devices with much greater energy savings. Replacement of current inefficient lighting by these LEDs will result in reduction of global carbon dioxide emissions, a major cause of global warming, among other things. WLEDs hold the potential, in the field of photonics, to be as transformational as the transistor was in electronics. This core device has the potential to revolutionize how we use light, including not only for illumination, but also for communications, sensing, navigation, imaging, and many more applications. In this tutorial we highlight some of the potentials.},
  Category                 = {VLC},
  Conclusion               = {In this tutorial we provide an overview on energy- efficient wireless applications using light. We discussed applications of optical wireless communications systems using ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared parts of the unregulated light spectrum. Use of white LEDs not only for lighting the homes but also as means for wireless inhouse communications was detailed. Using this new and developing technology along with powerlines communications can create a revolution in the area of consumer networking because of its efficiency and affordability.


After a brief description of several techniques for optical wireless indoor and outdoor systems for transmission, navigation and imaging, it has been determined that full-duplex indoors optical wireless transmission is feasible. Indoor lighting and downlink transmission can be achieved through the installation of an appropriate number of LEDs in the room. Communications coverage footprint follows the illumination pattern of LEDs; hence, by spotlighting, high-bit-rate islands (hotspots) can be created. A portable terminal will have a visible light photodiode and a near IR LED as well to enable full-duplex operation anywhere within the room. As such, the design of this optical wireless network is plausible and advantageous to the average home user and even small LANs as the cost is cheap, yet provides full-duplex communication and lighting. All these techniques incorporate small parts of our designs, and with success of applications and high-intensity LEDs, optical wireless technology is finally becoming a real complement for RF technologies in order to reduce RF interference. By incorporating these techniques, we are setting a new standard for reliable indoor optical wireless networking. There will no longer be a need for separate lighting and communication equipment as well as interference creating RF restrictions. With this technique consumers will have a network at a very low cost and with very little hardware and configuration. Briefly speaking, visible light communications is the best system, from ecological and human health perspectives, and can use the established retro-systems including the lighting facility as well as powerlines. This system is also free from the current radio regulations.

In terms of economic opportunities, we need to develop components that are optimized for the proposed applications rather than using available commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) units which, for the most part, are not optimum. This is a great way to bring back manufacturing and revive the economy.},

And we knew that the system made communicationand lighting possible. Next, we discussed about the influence of reflection and intersymbol interference. And we showed thatthe communication performance is degraded severely by intersymbol interference. In visible-light communicationsystem, the LED lights are distributed within a room and the irradiance of light is wide for function of lighting equipment.Therefore, the intersymbol interference depended on the data rate and the FOV of receiver. We explained the relationbetween the data rate and the FOV and suggested the potential of high speed data transmission like 10 Gb/s.

Many light sources can substitute LED. And visible-light communication system makes high data rate possible easily. Consequently, the visible-light communication system willexpect as indoor communication system of next generation. Further research on these would make LED lightingcommunication feasible.},

Depending on the way of placing the lens, in practice there are generally two kinds of receivers, namely the flat-surface and curved-surface receivers, where the former one uses the flat surface of lens to collect light from the LED while the latter one uses the curved surface. We first derive the channel gain of the single-input single-output (SISO) VLC system with a finite receiving area, and then compare the channel gains of the two receivers in various scenarios. It is shown that the flat-surface receiver could provide a wider FOV than the curved-surface receiver. We further study the performance of two receivers in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) VLC systems. Through the BER performance analysis, we find that high spatial multiplexing gain could be achieved by both receivers if the receiving plane is properly located.},

It has recently been shown that asymmetrically clipped optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (ACO-OFDM) is more efficient in terms of optical power than conventional optical modulation techniques such as pulse position modulation (PPM). When ACO-OFDM is used, the transmitted signal has a clipped Gaussian probability distribution. We calculate the channel capacity for systems using transmitted signals with exponential and clipped Gaussian distributions, and for an ACO-OFDM system. For practical signal to noise ratios, ACO-OFDM has a slightly lower capacity than the other distributions, due to the correlation between samples caused by the ACO-OFDM modulation process. ACO-OFDM has many practical advantages including its tolerance to multipath distortion. This paper shows that it also makes efficient use of the available power and bandwidth.},

ACO-OFDM produces a half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers, thus allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the need for DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. DCO-OFDM assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and a high DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED intensity. This paper considers a practical LED model and studies the performance of both systems in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit error ratio in the presence of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In addition, DC power consumption and the transmitted optical power for the two systems are compared. The analytical results are validated through Monte Carlo simulations and the obtained results demonstrate close match. It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of both systems and an optimum system design should take into account the OFDM signal power, DC-bias point, and LED dynamic range.},

  Conclusion               = {This paper has analyzed the performance of existing indoor OWC OFDM transmission techniques. Existing techniques are categorized based on the way data is assigned to subcarriers and the bipolar–unipolar conversion process. The ACO-OFDM OWC technique produces a half-wave symmetry time signal and allows clipping at the zero level, thus reducing DC power consumption by avoiding the need for a DC bias. These advantages are achieved at the expense of a major reduction in data rate as compared to DCO-OFDM systems. The performance of these systems in the presence of LED clipping clearly highlights the significant dependence on the considered modulation order and other system parameters, such as bias point value. It was shown that AWGN noise dominates at low SNR values and clipping distortion dominates at large SNR values. Therefore, system design should consider LED clipping effects and should optimize the OFDM signal power and the considered modulation order.

The analysis in this paper allows a simple method to optimize system parameters. An example was shown where an optimum DC-bias point is found for the considered LED in this paper. It is shown that the optimum DC-bias point for communication is different from the optimum DC-bias point suggested by the manufacturer, which mainly considers optimum brightness, long lifetime, and minimum temperature},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is an overview of indoor OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing)/DMT (discrete multitone) optical wireless (OW) communication systems. Indoor OW OFDM/DMT systems can be classified into two groups. One group produces half-wave symmetry time signal at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers. Thus, allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the need of DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. ACOOFDM (asymmetrically clipped OFDM system) and PAM (pulse amplitude modulation)-DMT are two techniques from the first group. The second group assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate. However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal before modulating the LED (light emitting diode) intensity. DC-biased OFDM and a novel technique, proposed in this paper, called orthogonal PAM-DMT (OPAM-DMT) that is an extension of the proposed PAM-DMT by using discrete sine transform and discrete cosine transform to transmit two orthogonal signals at the same time, are two techniques from the second group. This paper considerers a practical LED model and studies the performance of all these systems in terms of average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit-error-ratio (BER) in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise channel (AWGN). It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the performance of all these systems and the performance of these systems substantially depends on the considered modulation order.},

Channel imperfections include Rician fading, spatial correlation and mutual antenna coupling. Recently, SM-OFDM is proposed as a multi-antenna transmission approach that results in an increase in spectral efficiency by systematically mapping a block of information bits to a single transmit antenna (out of a set of antennas) and an information symbol. This principle is applied to each subchannel, i.e. for an entire OFDM symbol at any given subchannel and time instant only one antenna is transmitting. For each subchannel this might be a different antenna, though, depending on the sequence of incoming bits. Consequently, inter-channel interference (ICI) at the receiver input is entirely avoided while high spectral efficient is maintained. In this paper, the effect of channel imperfections on SM-OFDM and V-BLAST-OFDM for coded and uncoded systems are studied. For the same spectral efficiency and a BER (bit error ratio) of 10~3, SM-OFDM is shown to perform 4 dB better than V-BLAST-OFDM in the presence of Rician fading and by 7 dB in the presence of all channel imperfections.},

In this paper, a new transmission approach, called spatial modulation, that entirely avoids ICI and requires no synchronization between the transmitting antennas while maintaining high spectral efficiency is presented. A block of information bits is mapped into a constellation point in the signal and the spatial domain, i.e. into the location of a particular antenna. The receiver estimates the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number and uses the two information to de-map the block of information bits. For this purpose, a novel transmit antenna number detection algorithm called iterative-maximum ratio combining (i-MRC) is presented. Spatial modulation is used to transmit different number of information bits and i-MRC is used to estimate both the transmitted signal and the transmit antenna number. The results are compared to ideal V-BLAST (vertical-Bell Lab layered space-time) and to MRC. Spatial modulation outperforms MRC. The (bit-error-ratio) BER performance and the achieved spectral efficiency is comparable to V-BLAST. However, spatial modulation results in a vast reduction in receiver complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technique for indoor optical wireless (OW) communication is proposed. The technique is referred to as optical spatial modulation (OSM). The key concept is based on spatial modulation (SM). At any given time instant, only one transmitter is active and the others are inactive. A transmitter in space is considered as a spatial constellation point which is assigned a unique bit sequence. Consequently, transmitters are turned on and off depending on the incoming data bits, similar to the activation of constellation points in traditional digital modulation schemes. Hence, a data rate of the base two logarithm of the number of transmit units is achieved. The active transmitter radiates a certain intensity level at a particular time instant. At the receiver side, the optimal SM detector is slightly modified and used to estimate the spatial constellation point. The estimated spatial constellation point is used to arrive at the original bit stream via de-mapping. The upper bound bit-error-ratio (BER) of OSM is analyzed for a MIMO configuration consisting of four transmit units (light emitting diodes (LEDs)) and four receive units (photo diodes (PDs)) in a room. The BER performance is determined for different transmitter and receiver separation distances and different transmitter half power semiangles ( #x03A6;1/2). It is shown that the proposed OSM technique achieves twice and four times the data rate as compared to OOK (on-off keying) and PPM (pulse-position modulation), respectively.},

  Conclusion               = {This paper proposes a MIMO technique for OW communication. The technique avoids interference at the receiver by adopting the SM approach. At any given time instant, only one transmitter is active which emits a certain intensity level. The intensity level is a design parameter that can be set to optimize SNR and power consumption. It is found that low BER can be achieved at moderate SNR values. Reducing both the distance z and the angle FI1/2 results in lower correlation between the channel paths which leads to better performance. Methods to reduce the correlation between the channel paths by considering a diffuse link and optimized placements of transmitters and receivers will be considered in future works.},

In this letter, we describe a link that uses 16 LEDs which are modulated using a resonant driving technique, creating an overall BW of 25 MHz.

Present-day laser diodes have pulse rates many times higher than the bandwidth of multipath distorted diffuse channels. Despite the fact that the transmitter extra degrees of freedom are not supported by the low-pass channel, they can be used to satisfy the channel non-negativity constraint. In this paper, we define optical impulse modulation (OIM) in which data are confined to the low-pass region while the high-pass region, which is distorted by the channel, is used to satisfy the channel amplitude constraints. A mathematical framework for OIM is presented, and an optimal receiver filter is designed. At a normalized delay spread of 0.2, the gain in average optical power of using decision feedback equalization (DFE) with rectangular pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) is 4.8 dBo, while that of using the less complex unequalized OIM receiver is shown to be 4.9 dBo.},

Therefore it is a common belief that white light produced by a set of lasers of different colors would not be of high enough quality for general illumination. We tested this belief experimentally, and found the opposite to be true. This result paves the way for the use of lasers in solid-state lighting.},

  Abstract                 = {Indoor optical wireless systems provide an attractive alternative for realizing next generation wireless local area networks (WLANs). In this paper, the performance of diffuse optical wireless systems, employing space time block coding (STBC) techniques, is numerically investigated, accurately taking into account, the indoor channel impulse response and the characteristics of ambient light and thermal noises at the receiver. Discrete multitone modulation (DMT) is used to mitigate the effect of intersymbol interference due to the channel's impulse response. The performance of STBC systems, employing two transmit elements, is compared against single input/ single output (SISO) and maximum ratio combining (MRC) systems operating with the same total optical transmitter power. It is shown that STBC techniques can be used to increase the capacity of diffuse optical wireless systems, improve their coverage and decrease the required optical power at the transmitter. These results demonstrate the usefulness of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) techniques in the realization of optical WLANs.},

  Abstract                 = {Line-of-sight free-space optical links can provide extremely high bandwidth communications, but this usually requires that transmitter and receiver are precisely aligned. In order to allow terminals to be mobile, links must be able to track users within their field of view so that the link is maintained. There are various means to do this, but all require complex subsystems with a number of different optical, optoelectronic, and electrical components. A solid-state tracking architecture is introduced and a seven-channel tracking system demonstration described. The system is designed to operate at 155 Mb/s and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first that uses an integrated approach. Arrays of novel resonant cavity LED (RCLED) emitters that operate at 980 nm are used as sources. These are flip-chip bonded to arrays of CMOS driver circuits and integrated with the necessary transmitter optics. The receiver uses a back-illuminated detector array flip-chip bonded to arrays of custom CMOS receivers. All these components are custom and have performance substantially better than nonoptimized commercially available components. In the paper, the design and fabrication of the optics, optoelectronics, and electronics required for this is described. Successful operation of all the subsystems is detailed, together with results from an initial link demonstration.},

  Abstract                 = {Line-of-sight optical wireless systems have the potential to provide extremely high bandwidth communications; the major problem is to ensure that a link can be maintained as transmitter and receiver move relative to one another, and to provide wide area coverage.

In the paper, the construction and testing of a cellular tracked demonstration optical wireless link that employs a 3 times;3 array of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers in the transmitter and a 3 times;3 array of silicon photodiodes in the receiver is reported. The link operates at 32.77 Mbit/s and is demonstrated to provide coverage to a BER of 1 times;10-9 across an area of 0.8 m times; 0.8 m at a link distance of 2.5 m. This is believed to be the first reported cellular tracked link that demonstrates tracking in two dimensions. Consideration is given to extending the coverage area of the link.},

  Conclusion               = {The results presented in this paper demonstrate the feasibility of the cellular tracked architecture for a focused coverage area. The demonstration link is able to provide data transfer at 32.77 Mbit/s to a BER of 1 x 10^-9 for all positions within an area of 0.8m square, for a transmitter to receiver separation of 2.5 m. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such link demonstrating cellular tracking in two dimensions. Modelling indicates an increased link margin is required to scale to a practical system size, either using increased transmitter power or a more sensitive receiver. Given this, and careful optical design, systems can scale to provide practical coverage areas. Work on systems that can do this is underway.},

  Abstract                 = {For future short- and mid-range industrial applications, optical free-space communication systems are expected to play a major role. When moderate transmission rates (100 Mbps range) are required, optical wireless communications present a viable and promising technology supplemental to conventional radio wireless systems. Advanced approaches based on diversity techniques and adaptive signal processing show potential to achieve both high spatial coverage and high bit rates of more than 100 Mbps. Visible light communication systems using white phosphorescent LEDs present equally an interesting application potential, combining illumination with data transfer. When high data volumes (100 Gbps range) need to be transmitted, tailored optical data links provide a solution of choice. Exemplarily, a scalable (24 - 140 Gbps) optical data link is presented, developed for future implementation in maskless lithography systems. The link comprises a high-speed data buffer with synchronizable architecture and scalable throughput (N times 24 Gbps), an optical free space transmission solution, and, finally, a 45 channel low-noise optical receiver chip based on BiCMOS 0.6 mum technology.},

Due to the limited bandwidth of optical sources, it is challenging to achieve high data rate in optical wireless systems. In order to obtain a multiplexing gain and high spectral efficiency, we design an optical multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system utilizing a singular value decomposition-based spatial multiplexing and adaptive modulation. We note that the conventional allocation method in radio frequency MIMO channels cannot be applied directly to the optical intensity channels. In this paper, we generalize the result of power allocation method in [1] for arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas in optical wireless MIMO systems. Based on three constraints, namely, the nonnegativity, the aggregate optical power, and the bit error rate requirement, we propose a novel method to allocate the optical power, the offset value, and the modulation size for maximum sum rate. From some selected simulation results, we show that our proposed allocation method gives a better spectral efficiency than the method that allocates the optical power equally for each data stream.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a low complexity spatial modulation (SM) scheme that combines spatial shift keying (SSK) with pulse position modulation (PPM) for optical wireless communication systems. SM is a multi-transmitter technique for achieving increased data rate over the traditional on-off keying (OOK) and PPM signalling methods. Analysis of the error performance of the system in the presence of noise is presented and validated via simulations. There is a perfect agreement between the simulation and the theoretical analysis for the case of M = 2 bits/symbol and other values of M at symbol error rate (SER) of less than 10-2. At higher SER values the analytical prediction is about 1.2 dB more than that of the simulation. We also show the energy efficiency/bandwidth requirement trade-off involved when determining the system parameters such as the number of transmitters and the number of bits per symbol M. Using fewer transmitters improves the energy efficiency but requires more bandwidth. Moreover, the error performance of SPPM is dictated by both the individual channel gains of the multiple transmitters and the difference between these channel gains or path losses. Hence, distinct channel gains are a prerequisite in spatial modulation. An experimental set up to measure and show the dependence of the channel gains on the relative position of the transmitter to the receiver is also presented. These measured channel parameters are then used to evaluate the system error performance. The performance of the SPPM is also compared, in terms of energy and spectral efficiencies, with the classical SSK and repetition coded (RC) schemes in which the multiple transmitters are used to transmit the same data simultaneously. The results show the SPPM as a multi-transmitter signalling scheme that combines the energy efficiency of the PPM with the high spectral efficiency of the SSK.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless network data consumption is experiencing drastic increases due to growing demands of mobile services and applications. Deployed networks using Radio Frequency (RF) communications are characterized by a shared medium, limited available spectrum and limited ability to scale with increasing demand. Directional communications, including Visible Light Communications (VLC), can limit contention in controlled environments and provide scalability through spatial reuse of the medium. This solution can provide massive aggregate data capacity in indoor scenarios if properly distributed. In this paper we propose an indoor hybrid system that integrates WiFi and VLC luminaries. Our system utilizes (i) broadcast VLC channels to supplement RF communications and (ii) a handover mechanism between WiFi and VLC to dynamically distribute resources and optimize system throughput. This approach offers the bandwidth density benefits of VLC, provides a non-intrusive RF back-channel, maintains compatibility with conventional RF devices, and demonstrates excellent scalability. Analytical and simulation results show improvements in aggregate performance (i.e., throughput and delay) of the hybrid, when compared to either system acting alone.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we propose a spatial multiplexing technique for the downlink of a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) system. For outdoor environments with a limited angular spread at the base station, the proposed technique is able to separate the users' streams through a joint spatial processing at both the transmitter and the receiver requiring only a limited feedback from each user. Adaptive transmission is adopted on each stream to set a fixed probability of error. Numerical simulations show that the proposed technique is able to provide significant throughput gains compared to fixed-beams based approaches proposed in the literature.},
  Category                 = {MIMO OFDM},
  Conclusion               = {An SDMA technique for a MIMO OFDM FDD system has been proposed. It has been shown that the same time-frequency unit can be scheduled to several users in the same coverage area leading to a more efficient use of channel resources. Although users’ subset at the BS is suboptimally designed according to partial CSI in the form of spatial frequencies and SINR lower bounds, significant benefits compared to the fixed GoB approach could be attained exploiting the channel spatial structure and the precoder adaptation. Such high throughput gains are uniformly distributed among each scheduled channel, as a consequence they justify a reasonable complexity growth at the receiver, due to both channel (and spatial frequency) estimation processing, and the need for a greater number of pilot symbols. Both clever scheduling based on spatial separation among users, precoding processing at the transmitter and spatial MVDR filtering at the receiver have a substantial impact on the MUI reduction. Finally, significant benefits also in coverage capabilities could be achieved exploiting precoders adaptation.},

Currently, no work has been published which details the performance of this standardised modulation scheme that can be used by the CSK developers as a baseline. In this work, the various colour band combinations (CBCs) of multilevel CSK are studied and their performance over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and the dispersive optical wireless channel is detailed. The analysis of the performance evaluation suggests that CSK has a spread of BER performance, i.e. all the colour band combinations do not have the same BER performance. For the AWGN channel, CBC-2 (CBC no. 2) has an electrical SNR gain of up to 2.5 dB over the other eight CBCs of CSK. The performance evaluation suggests that the CBC-2 is also the most robust CBC of CSK to be used over the dispersive optical channel.},

The main tenor is that an overall system architecture should be worked out that provides industry with plenty of scope for product differentiation. This architecture should feature affordability, scalability, modularity, extendibility, and interoperability.

  Abstract                 = { The use of multiple laser transmitters combined with multiple photodetectors is studied for terrestrial, line-of-sight optical communication. The resulting multiple-input multiple-output channel has the potential for combatting fading effects on turbulent optical channels. In this paper, the modulation format is repetition Q-ary PPM across lasers, with intensity modulation. Ideal photodetectors are assumed, with and without background radiation. Both Rayleigh and log-normal fading models are treated. The focus is upon both symbol/bit error probability for uncoded transmission, and on channel capacity.},

  Conclusion               = {We have analyzed an optical MlMO system employing Q-ary PPM across sources, together with direct detection. Both lognormal and Rayleigh fading models have been treated, assuming independent fading on sourceldetector pairs. The analysis shows the beneficial effects from a diversity standpoint of multiple sources and detectors, and transmit diversity is achieved here without additional special coding.
 Some aspects of the optical MlMO system here mimic those of the microwave MlMO systems. Full transmit diversity can be shown analytically for the no-background case. Even for the case of normal background radiation, Q-PPM is still able to approach the performance of the unfaded case by increasing the number of transmit antenna. However, due to the alphabet constraint, the capacity in bits per vector channel use does not grow linearly with M = iV. One could envision letting Q become large as the array size does, which might restore this attractive capacity growth.},

  Abstract                 = {Colour and spectral imaging systems typically use filters and glass prisms to disperse light of different wavelengths. With the miniaturization of integrated devices, current research on imaging sensors focuses on novel designs aiming at high efficiency, low power consumption and slim dimension, which poses great challenges to the traditional colourant-based filtering and prism-based spectral splitting techniques. In this context, surface plasmon-based nanostructures are attractive due to their small dimensions and the ability to efficiently manipulate light. In this article we use selective conversion between free-space waves and spatially confined modes in plasmonic nanoresonators formed by subwavelength metal–insulator–metal stack arrays to show that the transmission spectra through such arrays can be well controlled by using simple design rules, and high-efficiency colour filters capable of transmitting arbitrary colours can be achieved. These artificial nanostructures provide an approach for high spatial resolution colour filtering and spectral imaging with extremely compact device architectures.},

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state lighting is a rapidly growing area of research and applications, due to the reliability and predicted high efficiency of these devices. The white LED sources that are typically used for general illumination can also be used for data transmission, and Visible Light Communications (VLC) is a rapidly growing area of research. One of the key challenges is the limited modulation bandwidth of sources, typically several MHz. However, as a room or coverage space would typically be illuminated by an array of LEDs there is the potential for parallel data transmission, and using optical MIMO techniques is potentially attractive for achieving high data rates. In this paper we investigate non-imaging and imaging MIMO approaches: a non-imaging optical MIMO system does not perform properly at all receiver positions due to symmetry, but an imaging based system can operate under all foreseeable circumstances. Simulations show such systems can operate at several hundred Mbit/s, and up to Gbit/s in many circumstances.},
  Category                 = {MIMO},
  Conclusion               = {An imaging diversity receiver, combined with MIMO processing techniques allows ‘alignment free’ high data rate communications. 

The most power efficient scheme is to use the white LED channel, as the power penalties in using the higher bandwidth equalized and blue filtered channels are greater than the simple power splitting involved in using multiple white channels. However, in practical cases the complexity of the large number of channels may make a smaller number of high bandwidth channels more attractive. At present the receiver imaging lens and detector array size are large for some configurations, and are not likely to be practical for some applications. 

In both cases data rates from several hundred Mbit/s to 1Gbit/s can be achieved. 

The systems analysed in this paper to some extent represent the ’limiting cases’-that of imaging and non-imaging, and it may be that some hybrid system offers a means of creating a system that can use a more compact receiver array. This is worthy of further work, as it is an open question as to what optical system creates the best optical MIMO system.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper constructs a model for Optical Spatial Modulation Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-SM-OFDM). It investigates the effects of different power allocation schemes on bit error ratio (BER) performance. Optical features such as the DCO technique, the LED non-linearity and the indoor optical channel are considered. Under power constraint, when making power difference between transmitters, we discussed trade-off between the accuracy of the spatial domain bits detection and that of signal domain bits detection. We investigated the relationship between transmitter power surplus, spatial BER, signal BER, system total BER and signal to noise ratio (SNR). The optimal point of transmission power difference is found to be around 11.5 dB.},

  Abstract                 = {Changes in gait parameters have been shown to be an important indicator of several age-related cognitive and physical declines of older adults. In this paper we propose a method to monitor and analyze walking and cycling activities based on a triaxial accelerometer worn on one ankle. We use an algorithm that can (1) distinguish between static and dynamic functional activities, (2) detect walking and cycling events, (3) identify gait parameters, including step frequency, number of steps, number of walking periods, and total walking duration per day, and (4) evaluate cycling parameters, including cycling frequency, number of cycling periods, and total cycling duration. Our algorithm is evaluated against the triaxial accelerometer data obtained from a group of 297 middle-aged to older adults wearing an activity monitor on the right ankle for approximately one week while performing unconstrained daily activities in the home and community setting. The correlation coefficients between each of detected gait and cycling parameters on two weekdays are all statistically significant, ranging from 0.668 to 0.873. These results demonstrate good test-retest reliability of our method in monitoring walking and cycling activities and analyzing gait and cycling parameters. This algorithm is efficient and causal in time and thus implementable for real-time monitoring and feedback.},

The visible light spectrum extends from 380 nm to 780 nm in wavelength. The standard is capable of delivering data rates sufficient to support audio and video multimedia services and also considers mobility of the visible link, compatibility with visible-light infrastructures, impairments due to noise and interference from sources like ambient light and a MAC layer that accommodates visible links.
