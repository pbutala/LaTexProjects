\chapter{Optical MIMO: Exploring the color dimension}

As seen in previous chapter, imaging receivers have the potential to to provide significant performance gains for a spatial MIMO OWC system. To incorporate these in portable devices, they must address challenges of being low powered, have fast sampling rates while incorporating optics, sensor and electronics in a small form factor.

This chapter explores the color dimension to establish an optical MIMO channel. It investigates color shift keying (CSK) as specified in IEEE 80.15.7 standard PHY  \rmnum{3}. The standard specifies a simplified linear system model for CSK. The human visual perception model is non--linear and needs to be considered while providing illumination. Thus a non--linear CSK model is investigated for different color band combinations. Luminous-signal-to-noise ratio metric is introduced to make fair performance comparisons between different modulation techniques operating at different average radiant flux, but same average luminous flux levels. Metameric modulation then further explores color dimension by using multiple sets of LEDs to transmit information over metamerically equivalent SPDs \cite{but12a}.
