  abstract = {In this paper, we compare the performance of multiple-input-multiple-output
	(MIMO) techniques applied to indoor optical wireless communications
	(OWC) assuming line-ofsight (LOS) channel conditions. Specifically,
	several 4 × 4 setups with different transmitter spacings and different
	positions of the receiver array are considered. The following MIMO
	algorithms are considered: Repetition Coding (RC), Spatial Multiplexing
	(SMP) and Spatial Modulation (SM). Particularly, we develop a framework
	to analytically approximate the bit error ratios (BERs) of these
	schemes and verify the theoretical bounds by simulations. The results
	show that due to diversity gains, RC is robust to various transmitter-receiver
	alignments. However, as RC does not provide spatial multiplexing
	gains, it requires large signal constellation sizes to enable high
	spectral efficiencies. In contrast, SMP enables high data rates by
	exploiting multiplexing gains. In order to provide these gains, SMP
	needs sufficiently low channel correlation. SM is a combined MIMO
	and digital modulation technique. We show that SM is more robust
	to high channel correlation compared to SMP, while enabling larger
	spectral efficiency compared to RC. Moreover, we investigate the
	effect of induced power imbalance between the multiple transmitters.
	It is found that power imbalance can substantially improve the performance
	of both SMP and SM as it reduces channel correlation. In this context,
	we also show that blocking some of the links is an acceptable method
	to reduce channel correlation. Even though the blocking diminishes
	the received energy, it outweighs this degradation by providing improved
	channel conditions for SMP and SM. For example, blocking 4 of the
	16 links of the 4 × 4 setup improves the BER performance of SMP by
	more than 20 dB, while the effective signal to noise ratio (SNR)
	is reduced by about 2 dB due to the blocking. Therefore, MIMO techniques
	can provide gains even under LOS conditions which - rovide only little
	channel differences.},

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the performance of indoor orthogonal frequency
	division multiplexing (OFDM) optical wireless communication systems
	in the presence of light emitting diode (LED) nonlinear distortions.
	There are several forms of optical OFDM using intensity modulation
	[7th Int. Symp. on Communication Systems Networks and Digital Signal
	Processing (CSNDSP), 2010, pp. 566-570]. In this paper, DC-biased
	optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM)
	are considered. ACO-OFDM produces a half-wave symmetry time signal
	at the output of the OFDM modulator by special assignment of subcarriers,
	thus allowing signal clipping at the zero level and avoiding the
	need for DC bias at the expense of data rate reduction. DCO-OFDM
	assigns data to all possible subcarriers to increase the data rate.
	However, half-wave symmetry signals cannot be achieved and a high
	DC bias is needed to convert the bipolar signal to a unipolar signal
	before modulating the LED intensity. This paper considers a practical
	LED model and studies the performance of both systems in terms of
	average electrical OFDM signal power versus bit error ratio in the
	presence of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. In addition,
	DC power consumption and the transmitted optical power for the two
	systems are compared. The analytical results are validated through
	Monte Carlo simulations and the obtained results demonstrate close
	match. It is shown that LED clipping has significant impact on the
	performance of both systems and an optimum system design should take
	into account the OFDM signal power, DC-bias point, and LED dynamic
	range.},

  conclusion = {This paper has analyzed the performance of existing indoor OWC OFDM
	transmission techniques. Existing techniques are categorized based
	on the way data is assigned to subcarriers and the bipolar–unipolar
	conversion process. The ACO-OFDM OWC technique produces a half-wave
	symmetry time signal and allows clipping at the zero level, thus
	reducing DC power consumption by avoiding the need for a DC bias.
	These advantages are achieved at the expense of a major reduction
	in data rate as compared to DCO-OFDM systems. The performance of
	these systems in the presence of LED clipping clearly highlights
	the significant dependence on the considered modulation order and
	other system parameters, such as bias point value. It was shown that
	AWGN noise dominates at low SNR values and clipping distortion dominates
	at large SNR values. Therefore, system design should consider LED
	clipping effects and should optimize the OFDM signal power and the
	considered modulation order.
	
	
	The analysis in this paper allows a simple method to optimize system
	parameters. An example was shown where an optimum DC-bias point is
	found for the considered LED in this paper. It is shown that the
	optimum DC-bias point for communication is different from the optimum
	DC-bias point suggested by the manufacturer, which mainly considers
	optimum brightness, long lifetime, and minimum temperature},

	is based on spatial modulation (SM). At any given time instant, only

	assigned a unique bit sequence. Consequently, transmitters are turned
	on and off depending on the incoming data bits, similar to the activation

	Hence, a data rate of the base two logarithm of the number of transmit
	units is achieved. The active transmitter radiates a certain intensity
	level at a particular time instant. At the receiver side, the optimal
	SM detector is slightly modified and used to estimate the spatial
	constellation point. The estimated spatial constellation point is
	used to arrive at the original bit stream via de-mapping. The upper

	avoids interference at the receiver by adopting the SM approach.
	At any given time instant, only one transmitter is active which emits
	a certain intensity level. The intensity level is a design parameter
	that can be set to optimize SNR and power consumption. It is found
	that low BER can be achieved at moderate SNR values. Reducing both
	the distance z and the angle FI1/2 results in lower correlation between
	the channel paths which leads to better performance. Methods to reduce
	the correlation between the channel paths by considering a diffuse
	link and optimized placements of transmitters and receivers will
	be considered in future works.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a low complexity spatial modulation (SM) scheme
	that combines spatial shift keying (SSK) with pulse position modulation
	(PPM) for optical wireless communication systems. SM is a multi-transmitter
	technique for achieving increased data rate over the traditional
	on-off keying (OOK) and PPM signalling methods. Analysis of the error
	performance of the system in the presence of noise is presented and
	validated via simulations. There is a perfect agreement between the
	simulation and the theoretical analysis for the case of M = 2 bits/symbol
	and other values of M at symbol error rate (SER) of less than 10-2.
	At higher SER values the analytical prediction is about 1.2 dB more
	than that of the simulation. We also show the energy efficiency/bandwidth
	requirement trade-off involved when determining the system parameters
	such as the number of transmitters and the number of bits per symbol
	M. Using fewer transmitters improves the energy efficiency but requires
	more bandwidth. Moreover, the error performance of SPPM is dictated
	by both the individual channel gains of the multiple transmitters
	and the difference between these channel gains or path losses. Hence,
	distinct channel gains are a prerequisite in spatial modulation.
	An experimental set up to measure and show the dependence of the
	channel gains on the relative position of the transmitter to the
	receiver is also presented. These measured channel parameters are
	then used to evaluate the system error performance. The performance
	of the SPPM is also compared, in terms of energy and spectral efficiencies,
	with the classical SSK and repetition coded (RC) schemes in which
	the multiple transmitters are used to transmit the same data simultaneously.
	The results show the SPPM as a multi-transmitter signalling scheme
	that combines the energy efficiency of the PPM with the high spectral
	efficiency of the SSK.},
